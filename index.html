            "Flowers are like friends; They bring color to your world." "A
            flower is a smile from heaven." "In joy or sadness, flowers are our
            constant friends." "Even the tiniest of flowers can have the
            toughest roots.Flowers are a gift to this earth. As Gerard De Nerval
            once said, “Every flower is a soul blossoming in nature.” They paint
            contrasting colors along the ground and bring joy to many. Their
            elegance and delicate touches have us all in awe and exhilaration.
